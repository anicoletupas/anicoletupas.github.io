    <p>
      I have little experience with web development, but HTML and CSS always interested me ever since I was a teenager.
      I grew up using the Internet a lot especially during the early 2010's. Through exploring different websites, I found out about HTML and CSS, but never tried to learn it myself.
      I began programming and coding during my high school AP Computer Science class.

      I hope to learn how to properly make use of HTML and CSS to make websites on my own. I think learning them is essential to my skills as a programmer.
